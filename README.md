## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

In this project, I refined my CSS layout skills using Flexbox to center the component both vertically and horizontally, even without setting a fixed height for the viewport. Additionally, I learned about using CSS variables to manage colors and consistent styling.

Here's a code snippet of the main container setup:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
  padding: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to further explore responsive design techniques, especially around centering elements on different screen sizes without relying on fixed viewport units. Iâ€™ll also explore more accessible ways to present content.
